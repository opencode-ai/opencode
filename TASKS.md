# Task Management

This document tracks tasks managed by the OpenCode Nexus Orchestrator.

## Task Schema:

Each task can be represented as follows (e.g., in a table or structured list):

*   **Task ID:** Unique identifier (e.g., UUID)
*   **Description:** Detailed description of the task requirements.
*   **Status:** Pending | Assigned | In Progress | Blocked | Requires Review | Completed | Failed
*   **Assigned Agent ID:** ID of the Worker Agent the task is assigned to (if any).
*   **Dependencies:** List of Task IDs that must be completed before this task can start.
*   **Priority:** High | Medium | Low
*   **Created Timestamp:** When the task was created.
*   **Updated Timestamp:** When the task was last updated.
*   **Results/Artifacts:** Links to or descriptions of outputs upon completion.

## Current Tasks:
